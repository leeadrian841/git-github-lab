# Git and GitHub Intro Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Let's apply what we've learned from class to share and update each other's code.  With a partner, you're going going to alternate between who 'drives' and who 'navigates' while following the requirements under "Exercise" below. The goal will be to create a project, have a partner fork, clone, and edit the project, submit the changes as a pull request, and then have the changes merged.  

Be sure to look at the previous lesson for notes and helpful hints.

## Exercise

Partners will be referred to as partner1 and partner2.

### Part 1

**With partner1 driving:**

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice`
- within that folder create a new IntelliJ Project
- in that project, add two classes named `Car.java` and `Main.java`
- in the Main class, add the `public static void main` method
- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub


**With partner2 driving, from their computer:**

- get your partners link to the GitHub repository and fork and clone it
- import the project
    - add three member variables in the Car class
    - add a new class, `Garage.java`
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner1


**With partner1 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface



### Part 2

**With partner2 driving**:


- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice-two`
- within that folder create a new IntelliJ Project
- copy and paste the code from the merged pull request files (of your partners `git-and-github-practice` project) from each of the appropriate files to your own
- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub
> Note: Partner2 should now have the solution from Part 1 locally

**With partner1 driving:**

- get your partner's link to the new GitHub repository - fork and clone it
- open the project and make the main method, in the Main class, print "Hello World".
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner2


**With partner2 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface

**Bonus**:

- use the [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) documentation to update partner2's local version of `git-and-github-practice` without copying and pasting any code
- push the updated local copy to GitHub


#### Deliverable

You should have two separate GitHub repositories that have merged pull requests.
